Instructions:

1. Download the deals directory.

2. cd into the deals directory.

3. run: 

rails server

4. Once the server has finished initializing, you will see a line that includes the port #.  After that, bring up a browser and enter the url:

localhost:3000/conversion

5. Click "Choose File" and select example_input.tab in the deals directory or any other tab delimited file.

NOTE:  The example_input.tab that was downloaded from github was not purely tab delimited.  It had spaces between 2 of the columns.  The version of the same file that is included with this program is tab delimited.

6. Select Upload.

7. The file will now be converted and the data written to the database.  The total amount purchased will be displayed.




Other information:

1. To reload the data file without any data in the db, execute the following from a sql command line connected to the deal_development database:

delete from purchaser_deals;

delete from deals;

delete from merchants;

delete from purchasers;



Re-running the program will do no harm though, without deleting the data.



2. To see the data in the database, execute the following from a sql command line connected to the deal_development database:

select merchants.name, merchants.address, deals.description, deals.price, purchasers.name from merchants, deals, purchasers, purchaser_deals
where merchants.id=deals.merchant_id
and deals.id=purchaser_deals.deal_id
and purchasers.id=purchaser_deals.purchaser_id;



and the data in the individual tables can be seen by running:


select * from merchants;

select * from purchasers;

select * from deals;

select * from purchaser_deals;
